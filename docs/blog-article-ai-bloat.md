# How AI-Assisted Development Bloated My Project

<!--
  Draft outline — this article expands on the AI development experience
  from the Ruxlog project article. To be written and published separately.
-->

## The Promise

<!-- How AI tools (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kilo Code, Copilot) made planning and implementing features feel effortless -->

## The Trap

<!--
  - Features get implemented because they *can* be, not because they *should* be
  - OTEL auth, comments, user profiles, reports, banning — all fully built, none needed for MVP
  - The codebase grew faster than the ability to test and maintain it
-->

## The Real Cost

<!--
  - More surface area = more bugs, more testing, more cognitive load
  - AI generates code but doesn't own the system — inconsistent patterns, duplicated logic
  - Vibe coding features you're not fluent enough to debug
  - Time spent managing AI output > time saved by AI generating it
-->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!--
  - Strict MVP scope before touching any AI tool
  - AI for implementation within a defined scope, not for scope discovery
  - Feature flags saved me — without them the bloat would have been worse
  - The human still needs to be the architect
-->

## Takeaway

<!--
  - AI is an accelerator, not an autopilot
  - The bottleneck was never writing code — it was deciding what to build
  - Slowing down to think > speeding up to generate
-->
